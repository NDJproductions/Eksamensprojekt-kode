                <p> My name is Nikolaj and this page, is NDJ Productions.
                    This website represents me as a multimedia designer at UCL profession academy currently specialising in copywriting. 
                    
                    Outside of my current education I also have a bachelors degree in philosophy and mediascience, which help me in my work of becoming a better copywriter. 
                    
                    I have plenty of writing under my belt of many different kinds and so I strive to use my past experience along with my current education to evolve my skillset and become someone that can help businesses sell their products more efficiently and to the right people.</p>
