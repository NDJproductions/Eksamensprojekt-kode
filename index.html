                <p> My name is Nikolaj and this page, is NDJ Productions.
                    This website represents me as a multimedia designer at UCL profession academy currently specialising in copywriting. 
                    
                    Outside of my current education I also have a bachelors degree in philosophy and mediascience, which help me in my work of becoming a better copywriter. 
                    
                    I have plenty of writing under my belt of many different kinds and so I strive to use my past experience along with my current education to evolve my skillset and become someone that can help businesses sell their products more efficiently and to the right people.</p>

                <p> Many years of writing, both through education but also free time has given me a great deal of skills and experience both in analysing text and writing material for different projects.This has lead me to finding a passion in copywriting which has not only become my focus for my career in media design but also my future plans.Outside of my passion for writing, I`ve created and participated in several projects. Which has furthered my abilities as a multimedia designer.

                As visible on the projects page. My skillset includes more than just writing and copy, but also understanding and using tools such as Adobe programs, Figma, AI and general media productions.</p>
