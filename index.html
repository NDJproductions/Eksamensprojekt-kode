                <p> Many years of writing, both through education but also free time has given me a great deal of skills and experience both in analysing text and writing material for different projects.</p> 
                <p> This has lead me to finding a passion in copywriting which has not only become my focus for my career in media design but also my future plans. Outside of my passion for writing, I`ve created 
                and participated in several projects. Which has furthered my abilities as a multimedia designer.</p>
                <p>As visible on the projects page. My skillset includes more than just writing and copy, but also understanding and using tools such 
                as Adobe programs, Figma, AI and general media productions.</p>
