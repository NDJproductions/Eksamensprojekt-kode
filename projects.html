                    <p>One of the things I have worked on during my time as a student of multimediadesign is product placement and foto editing.</p>
                    <p>The editing is done mostly via Adobe photoshop, which I have become very familiar with during this time. And it is something I can offer to businesses as well.</p>

                    <p>What I highlighted in the previous project has come more to fruition thanks to learning about general photography. </p> 
                    <p> I`ve come to understand more about cameras, their settings, lighting and the setup needed to take great pictures.</p>
                    <p>It is a skillset I am happy to have learned and look forward to evolve.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the 1st semester, a great deal of our projects have been designed and developed via Figma.</p>
                    <p>This has given me a lot of experience and knowhow, not only in prototyping, but also in how these programs work, and what to do to make the most of them. Figma especially has become a stable in my workflow.</p>

                    <p>The Fabrication Laboratory at UCL has opened my eyes and given me access to new and interesting means of creating physical products.</p> 
                    <p>By using programs such as Adobe Illustrator, I've created and participated in making several physical prototypes. Some for my own personal use and others for school projects. This means that I have a license to be in and operate in Fab Lab's all over the world.</p>

                    <p>Aside from Photoshop, Illustrator and Figma, I have experience in programs such as Adobe AfterEffects as well. Creating and editing are a part of my skills in the world of media.</p>
                    <p>I have a good understanding of storyboarding and the principles behind animation and I always try to bring in a personal touch to my work.</p>

                    <p>Last but not least important, in every task or project IÂ´ve been a part of so far, a great deal of my work has been writing copy.</p>
                    <p>Whether it be small discriptions of products and salespeak for our website redesign in project 1, or making our mockup for project 2 feel more final and personal for the client.</p>
                    <p>My writing been a part of all of the group assignments and tasks. And my team members have been very supportive in including that, when they might have been focusing on the design aspects.</p>
                    <p>Due to the amount of copy I have done, I find it prevalent to include here as one of the 6 things I want to highlight about myself.</p>
